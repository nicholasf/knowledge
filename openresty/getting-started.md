## Getting Started

The easiest solution, in the end, was simply to install OpenResty via brew on OS X. Though only lua 5.2 was available 
via brew, so I found myself switching to Manjaro in VirtualBox for lua 5.3.

## Learning

There is a lack of information about how to write testable OpenResty apps using Lua scripting. 

The best tutorials I found were a three part series by Karl Seguin:
